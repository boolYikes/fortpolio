    - Don't use bind mounts: messy permissions
    - Inside container,
    - `chmod 700 /var/jenkins_home/.ssh`
    - `ssh-keyscan -t rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 github.com >> /var/jenkins_home/.ssh/known_hosts` or scm will not work 
    - `chmod 644 /var/jenkins_home/.ssh/known_hosts`

# Log
- Images in a MUI Box won't expand to its parents width even though they are explicit.
    - can only assume that the size of the image must be box-content-driven
    - IOW, the bg image is used as the bg of the texts, not the box element.
    - Read MUI docs for importing images
